👨‍💻 How to run it : 
1. clone the repo
2. run the main.py file with python ```python INT1_5_main.py ```
   
❓ What to do with it once its running ? 
1. Once everything is set, you'll be greeted with a beautiful title screen, and the program will ask you
on which automaton you want to work. You can pick any of the 44 test automata which are grouped in the 
automata.json file, located under the src/ folder. 
2. Once you chose your automaton you can do various things, concerning either :
   2.1. Display it - in the terminal 
   2.2. Standardize it - wip
   2.3. Determinize it - wip



conventions : 
- the empty word (\epsilon) is represented by the symbol "E" in our code
- when completing, you sometimes need to add a "bin" state. This state is identified as "P" in our code
